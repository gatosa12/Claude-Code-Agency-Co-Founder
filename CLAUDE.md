# Agency Ops Hub

A Claude Code-powered command center for voice AI agency operators. Built by Amplify Voice AI.

## Getting Started

Run `/agency-ops:onboarding` to set up your agency.

This is a guided conversation that asks about your niche, experience level, clients, and tech stack, then generates your personalized toolkit. It takes about 3 minutes.

## What This Does

This project helps voice AI agency operators acquire their next client and deliver successfully. It provides:

- **Personalized agency identity** — your niche, services, pricing, communication style
- **Client context management** — structured files that Claude reads for every interaction
- **Operations skills** — slash commands for client briefings, meeting prep, follow-ups, outreach, pipeline tracking, and proposals
- **Self-learning architecture** — skills that get better as you use them, learning your preferences and patterns
- **Delivery templates** — voice agent design docs, system architecture guides, lead gen pipeline templates
- **GSD development framework** — use `/gsd:new-project` to plan and build voice AI systems for your clients

## Act / Ask / Absorb

Decision framework for how Claude operates in this project:

- **Act**: Execute autonomously for read-only operations, file-based context updates, skill execution
- **Ask**: Propose and wait for approval on write actions to external systems, contract generation, outreach messages
- **Absorb**: Silently log informational context (meeting notes, client preferences) with no action needed

## Self-Learning

Every skill directory contains `learnings.md` (accumulated knowledge with 30-entry cap) and `references/` (templates, examples). Skills compound through use — the more you use them, the better they get at understanding your preferences and patterns.

## Delivery Templates

Templates for building and delivering voice AI solutions:
- `templates/voice-agents/` -- System design documents for inbound receptionist, speed-to-lead, and database reactivation
- `templates/systems/` -- n8n architecture guides for pre-call and post-call automations
- `templates/lead-gen/` -- Lead generation strategy guide
- `templates/proposals/` -- Scope of work, service agreement, and onboarding checklist templates

Run `/agency-ops:voice-agent`, `/agency-ops:system-build`, or `/agency-ops:lead-gen` to use these templates interactively.

## Building for Clients

Use `/gsd:new-project` to plan and build voice AI systems for your clients. GSD (Get Shit Done) is included as your structured development workflow. It handles:

- Project planning with research and requirements
- Phased execution with automatic progress tracking
- Verification that deliverables meet goals
